Before you can run any of the code in this section you will need a discord bot account and
the discord bot's token. The guide below will walk you through creating a discord bot account.

A bot token is a string of numbers that acts like a combination of a username and password for the bot.

Some functions will require a channel ID to tell the bot where to post it's message, but for many the bot
will simply post in the same channel that triggered the message. You can right-click on a channel to get
it's ID

A user ID can be used to make a function with a bot only reacts to one user. You can right-click to get 
the user ID for anyone

For more detail I recommend reading the documents
